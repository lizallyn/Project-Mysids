# Characterizing Mysid (Crustacea: Mysida) swarms and their co-occurrence with gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) in northwest Washington State

## Research Questions

### Descriptive:

-   What is the species composition of mysid shrimp in the study area?
-   What is the size, age, maturity composition of mysid shrimp in the
    study area?
-   How does mysid shrimp distribution vary by sample site?

### Modeling:

-   Does mysid shrimp density predict gray whale presence?

## Methods

## Data Organization

```{r}
# Read in Data
data <- read.csv("Er prey analysis for R fixed whale presence.csv")
```

## Model Construction

Response: 
Whale counts near sampling sites during sampling. Look at count distribution

```{r}
hist(data$whalecount)
```

The data are clearly zero-inflated, so we need to use a Hurdle model.

Pull out non-zero counts and check for overdispersion.

```{r}
# pull out non-zero counts
nonzero <- data[which(data$whalecount > 0),]

# look at them
hist(nonzero$whalecount)
```

The data seem likely to be overdispersed - mostly 1, with just a few observations of up to 8 whales. 

```{r message=F}
library(VGAM)

# construct model with mysid count
m1 <- vglm(whalecount ~ MysidCount, data = nonzero, family = "pospoisson")

# check for overdispersion
pchisq(sum(residuals(m1,type = "pearson")^2),nrow(nonzero)-2,lower.tail = FALSE)
# p = 0.000005, overdispersed

# fit with ZT neg binom
m2 <- vglm(whalecount ~ MysidCount, data = nonzero, family = posnegbinomial)
summary(m2)
```

Since the non-zero count data is overdispersed, we need to use the negative binomial distribution instead of Poisson in our hurdle model.

Next we will construct the hurdle model.

```{r}
library(pscl)
m.hurdle <- hurdle(whalecount ~ MysidCount|MysidCount, data = data, dist = "negbin")
summary(m.hurdle)
```


Fixed Effects: 
+ Mysid Count 
+ Mysid Avg Size 
+ Mysid Gravid Prop 
+ Mysid NR:HS Ratio (expect interaction w/count) 
+ Month 
+ Temp?
+ Kelp Cover?

Random Effects: 
+ Site 
+ Date?

## Diagnostics
