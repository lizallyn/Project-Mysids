# Project Mysids
 Gray whale prey analysis 2023. This repo has all the files associated with the manuscript accepted by PeerJ in November 2023 and the many analysis attempts leading up to that. Data files (.csv) called by R scripts are in the "Data Files" folder. The R Scripts used to create the final figures, tables, and in-text numbers are in the folder "R Scripts". Modeling attempts from spring/summer 2023 are in the folder "Modeling". "Recycle Bin" holds any files that are not called by a script in the Modeling or R Scripts files or any interim coding files that were not completed.
